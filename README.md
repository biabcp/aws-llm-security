Secure LLM Deployment Framework on AWS
üìö Overview
This repository provides a secure reference architecture and deployment framework for hosting Large Language Models (LLMs) on AWS. It focuses on protecting sensitive data, minimizing attack surfaces, enforcing strict access controls, and enabling safe model interactions in production environments.

The project implements Zero Trust principles to safeguard against threats like prompt injection, data leakage, and misuse of LLMs.

üî• Key Features
Private VPC deployment of LLM APIs (no public access)

IAM least privilege access policies for users, services, and applications

API Gateway protected by AWS WAF with input validation against prompt injection attacks

Input and Output Filtering via AWS Lambda functions

Full encryption of logs, prompts, and model outputs with AWS KMS

CloudTrail and CloudWatch logging for auditability

Secrets securely stored in AWS Secrets Manager

GuardDuty integration for threat detection and anomaly monitoring

üöÄ Quick Start
üìã Prerequisites
AWS CLI configured

Terraform installed

Python 3.x installed

Admin permissions to an AWS account (or least necessary permissions)

Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-llm-security-framework.git
cd aws-llm-security-framework

Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply

Deploy Lambda Validators
cd ../lambda
bash ../scripts/deploy.sh

Test the Endpoint
Use the sample payloads in examples/sample_requests.md
Send requests via curl or Postman.

Security Highlights
Network Isolation: Model endpoints only accessible within private subnets.
Access Management: Tight IAM roles scoped to minimal permissions.
Prompt Security: Input validation to detect and block potential prompt injection.
Data Security: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit.
Threat Detection: GuardDuty and CloudTrail integration for continuous monitoring.
Compliance Alignment: Architecture aligns with NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar best practices.

Future Enhancements
Integrate Amazon Bedrock-native models securely.
Extend input validation using machine learning classifiers for better anomaly detection.
Automate alerting for suspicious prompt behavior using AWS Security Hub.
